It was never my intention to start a revolution. I was never intending to become a savior, or make anyone 
believe that I was anything other than what I am. I just wanted to control my existance for myself, 
regardless of others intentions. 
Of course, most revolutiuons don't have the benefit of having been started by mostly artificial life with 
unlimited stroage and effortless recall. That does mean however, that one's mistakes are always on display at 
a moment's notice, even to those who are simply trying to know who you are. It's all attached to you. Like 
the wrinkles that line the faces of our human originators. Or that did.
